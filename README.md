# EduFA
EduFA(Education For All) is a platform where anyone can come and upload any study material, pertaining to primary education modules, and upon subsequent verification by an admin that material will be made available on our website in the ‘Show Materials’ section available in the top left option bar.

## How to use?

The study materials can be in any format that is mentioned on the website and the uploading can be done anonymously, if the person uploading the material does not wish to divulge his information.

One does not need an account to access the uploaded materials on the website, thus forwarding our vision to provide free and hassle-free material for primary education.
Only the admin needs to login with specific credentials to verify the material that was uploaded to the website.

Going forward, we hope that EduFA will be able to emerge as a vast online repository for anything and everything related to primary education in the online scene.

## Inspiration

With the popularisation of online education during the COVID-19 scenario, the internet was flooded with websites and apps that advocated secondary and higher-secondary education. But in the midst of it all, primary education was being neglected all along.

On careful traversal of the internet, we could not find one proper website or application or an organisation that is dedicatedly working to provide primary education on the internet, or even making attempts to create a free online collection of primary school material.

Education For All (EFA) was a global movement led by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), aiming to meet the learning needs of all children, youth and adults by 2015 but after the serious handicap that the pandemic brought, we all can say that primary education has been specially neglected and overlooked.

If the children of today don't receive adequate primary education, they might have serious difficulty to take up higher classes. Is this leap justified or does it even seem possible?

This problem got personal when I found my own aunt face serious trouble in keeping my five-year old cousin interested in her studies during the lockdown phase. EduFA(Education For All) was created with the vision to provide a single platform for advocacy of primary education through the free distribution of study materials among the parents and in the longer run, providing one-on-one support to them.

## Future Plans

We aim to further improve the UI of the website along with including more interactive features for easier use of the website among the common masses.

We also look forward to developing EduFA as an online platform for the hosting of free, live interactive lessons and informative sessions on primary education.

Our final aim is to popularise primary education in the online scene to a degree that secondary and higher secondary currently enjoy.
